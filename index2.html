                <h2>About Me / Elevator Pitch</h2>
                <p class="">Born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, I'm a web and graphic designer and developer with a fine art background. My first passion will always be sewing, fiber arts, and textiles, but I've fallen in love with the possibilities the digital world opens up. I have experience in content management, photography, coding, and graphic design. I'm someone that's happiest when my hands are busy, and I have a passion for problem solving and figuring things out.  My favorite projects have been the ones that allow me to work with others, and I'd love to hear more about any opportunities you know of within your organization! More of my portfolio work can be found on my website <a href="https://maddieoconnor.com">here</a></p>

          <h2>Sample Cover Letter</h2>
          <p>This is an unconventional cover letter-this is the letter I attached to my resume after attending an in-person second interview for my current internship. Because my first contact with the organization was through one of my professors, and my initial interviews were via phone and video call, it felt appropriate to write a cover letter as more of a 'thank-you' than an introduction.Notably, Park Hill has just offered me a full-time position as of December 2nd, 2021.  </p>
          <img src="assets/resources/phc-coverletter.jpg" alt="Dear Mrs. Scruggs,
          Thanks so much for taking the time to meet with me in person today. Our first interview was incredibly informative, and I look forward to learning even more about Park Hill. 
          From what I can tell, Park Hill’s success is built on people working as part of a team. With my unique combination of design, art, and web development skills, I believe I can help you move forward and connect with both your technology team and your customers on a new level. 
          I’m no stranger to small teams where every person has to fill multiple roles. I have experience in project management, team organization, web development, graphic design, and photography. My tech skills, combined with my organization skills, mean that I am in the perfect position to help organize and streamline team processes as Park Hill moves into 2022 and expands their web presence into the consumer market.  I love working with people, tackling big challenges and solving problems. From everything you’ve told me, it sounds like Park Hill needs one more person on their team. I strongly believe that person is me. 
          I look forward to hearing your decision, and invite you to reach out if you have any further questions. 
          Sincerely,
          Maddie O’Connor
